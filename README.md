# Murdock Flight Tracking Data

## Overview
This repository contains data recorded by my ADS-B receiver located in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire. The data is recorded by [FlightRadar24’s Feeder](https://www.flightradar24.com/share-your-data), decoded using [dump1090-mutability](https://github.com/adsb-related-code/dump1090-mutability/tree/master), and is finally processed using the [Swift-ADS-B-Statistics](https://github.com/cfridlington/Swift-ADS-B-Statistics) Package. The data is freely available for use via the [CC0 1.0 Universal license](https://github.com/cfridlington/murdock-flight-tracking-data/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Updates
Every morning at 12:00am a `cron job` commits and pushes changes to this repository. These changes contain the updated data from the previous 24 hour period.

## Example Use
As an example of how you can use this data, or data generated by your own ADS-B receiver running [Swift-ADS-B-Statistics](https://github.com/cfridlington/Swift-ADS-B-Statistics) I put together a [Flight Tracking webpage](https://www.cfridlington.com/misc/flight-tracking). This page allows you to see the aircraft seen by my ADS-B receiver in realtime and historical information. Furthermore data is visualized to create maps of the day’s flight paths and a contour map showing the density of the aircraft positions.

## Files
Since the files in this repository are the product of [Swift-ADS-B-Statistics](https://github.com/cfridlington/Swift-ADS-B-Statistics), more detailed documentation can be found in that repository’s `README.md`. As an overview, here is what each file represents:
- `aircraft_frequent_tails.json` is a list of aircraft that have been frequently seen by the ADS-B receiver.
- `aircraft_frequent_types.json` is a list of frequent aircraft types that have been seen by the ADS-B receiver.
- `aircraft_manufacturers.json` is a dictionary of all manufacturers and model types that have been seen by the ADS-B receiver.
- `aircraft_recently_tracked.json` is a list of aircraft that have been tracked recently by the ADS-B receiver.
- `flight_paths/flight_paths_overview.json` is a list of dates, in unix-epoch time, that have corresponding `flight_path_##########.json`.
- `flight_paths/flight_path_##########.json` is a dictionary containing the paths aircraft have taken in a given day. The data is organized by aircraft ADS-B ICAO into a dictionary of where the keys represent the time the aircraft was first seen and values of an array of messages that contain latitude and longitude coordinates. Aircraft that are seen multiple times a day are recorded as a separate entry after 1 hour.
- `history_complete.json` is a dictionary containing a complete record of every aircraft that has even been seen by the ADS-B receiver.
- `statistics.json`: is a dictionary that contains fields representing the total aircraft seen, the total manufacturers seen, the most frequent aircraft seen, the most frequent aircraft type seen, the total flights seen, and the total callsigns seen.

## What’s with the name?
Murdock is the nickname of the Raspberry Pi Zero that processes the raw ADS-B transmissions, hence this repository is named `murdock-flight-tracking-data`. The name is a reference to the name of the co-pilot in the 80’s film [Airplane!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane!) played by [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar).
